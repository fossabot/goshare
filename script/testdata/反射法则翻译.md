## 介绍

反射是一种程序检查其自身类型结构的能力。它是元编程的一种形式。也是混乱的重要来源。

本文我们通过样例来阐述反射在Go中是如何工作的。每种语言的反射模型都是不同的(有些语言根本不支持),本文是关于Go，所以下文中的"反射"都代表"Go中的反射"。

## 类型和接口

由于反射是建立在类型系统上的，所以先回顾一下Go中的类型。

Go是静态类型的。每个变量有一个静态类型，即在编译期有一个唯一固定的类型: int, float32, *MyType, []byte 等。 如果我们声明

```
type MyInt int

var i int
var j MyInt
```

那么i 是int类型， j是 MyInt类型。i和j有不同的静态类型，尽管他们有相同的底层类型，它们在没有类型转换情况下，不能相互赋值。

接口类型是一种重要的类型种类，它代表了一个固定的方法集。 一个接口类型变量可以存储任何实现改接口方法的具体值(非接口值)。 常见的例子是io.Reader和io.Writer，他们是io包中的。

```
// Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

// Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.
type Writer interface {
    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

任何类型只要按照相应的方法签名实现了Read(或 Writer)方法，即实现了io.Reader(io.Writer)接口。
这意味着一个io.Reader类型的变量可以保存一个任意有Read方法的类型。

```
var r io.Reader
r = os.Stdin
r = bufio.NewReader(r)
r = new(bytes.Buffer)
// and so on
```

重要的一点是无论r保存了什么具体的值，r的类型总是io.Reader。 Go是静态类型的，r变量的静态类型是io.Reader。

另外一个关于接口类型的重要例子：

```
interface{}
```

它代表一个空的方法集，因为任何值都有0个或更多方法，所以任何值都满足空接口。

有些人认为Go的接口是动态类型的，这是错误的。它们是静态类型的: 一个接口类型变量总有一个静态类型，即使运行时存储在接口变量的值会改变为其他类型，但是改变后的值还满足接口类型的。

我们需要准确的区分这些内容，因为反射和接口是紧密相关的。

## 接口的表示

Russ Cox 写过一篇关于接口值在Go中是如何表示的 详细的博客。没必要在这里重复整篇文章，一个简要的总结如下。

一个接口类型变量存储了一对: 赋值给变量的具体值 和 这个值的类型描述符。 更详细的说，**值**是实现了接口的底层数据项,**类型**是描述了完整类型的项。 例如，

```
var r io.Reader
tty, err := os.OpenFile("/dev/tty", os.O_RDWR, 0)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
r = tty
```

r包含的(值, 类型)对 是(tty, *os.File). 注意`*os.File`类型不仅实现了Read方法; 即使通过接口仅可以访问Read方法, 值的内部携带了所有的类型信息. 这是为什么可以这样做的的原因:

```
var w io.Writer
w = r.(io.Writer)
```
这是一个**类型断言**; 它断言了r实现了io.Writer接口, 所以我们可以将其赋值为w. 赋值后，w包含的一对数据是(tty, *os.File)。折合这和r相同。接口的静态类型决定了一个接口变量可以调用哪些方法，即使内部的实际值可能会包含更大的方法集。

接下来，我们可以做:

```
var empty interface{}
empty = w
```
之后，空接口变量empty也会有相同的一对数据（tty, *os.File)。这代表了：一个空接口可以存储任何值，并且包含了我们需要的关于值的所有信息。

（在这里，我们不需要类型断言，因为w总是满足空接口。在例子中，哦我们将一个值从Reader转换成Writer，我们需要明确使用类型断言，因为Writer的方法集不是Reader的方法集的子集。）

一个重要的细节是在接口中的一对值，总是（值 , 具体类型)的格式，并且不能是(值 , 接口类型)。 接口不能存储接口的值。

现在我们准备好学习反射了。

反射法则
1. 反射是从接口值到反射对象。
在基本情况下，反射只是一种检查一个接口变量中类型和值的机制。通常，我们需要了解reflect保重的两个类型: Type 和 Value。这两种类型

The first law of reflection
1. Reflection goes from interface value to reflection object.
At the basic level, reflection is just a mechanism to examine the type and value pair stored inside an interface variable. To get started, there are two types we need to know about in package reflect: Type and Value. Those two types give access to the contents of an interface variable, and two simple functions, called reflect.TypeOf and reflect.ValueOf, retrieve reflect.Type and reflect.Value pieces out of an interface value. (Also, from the reflect.Value it's easy to get to the reflect.Type, but let's keep the Value and Type concepts separate for now.)

Let's start with TypeOf:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

func main() {
    var x float64 = 3.4
    fmt.Println("type:", reflect.TypeOf(x))
}
This program prints

type: float64
You might be wondering where the interface is here, since the program looks like it's passing the float64 variable x, not an interface value, to reflect.TypeOf. But it's there; as godoc reports, the signature of reflect.TypeOf includes an empty interface:

// TypeOf returns the reflection Type of the value in the interface{}.
func TypeOf(i interface{}) Type
When we call reflect.TypeOf(x), x is first stored in an empty interface, which is then passed as the argument; reflect.TypeOf unpacks that empty interface to recover the type information.

The reflect.ValueOf function, of course, recovers the value (from here on we'll elide the boilerplate and focus just on the executable code):

var x float64 = 3.4
fmt.Println("value:", reflect.ValueOf(x).String())
prints

value: <float64 Value>
(We call the String method explicitly because by default the fmt package digs into a reflect.Value to show the concrete value inside. The String method does not.)

Both reflect.Type and reflect.Value have lots of methods to let us examine and manipulate them. One important example is that Value has a Type method that returns the Type of a reflect.Value. Another is that both Type and Value have a Kind method that returns a constant indicating what sort of item is stored: Uint, Float64, Slice, and so on. Also methods on Value with names like Int and Float let us grab values (as int64 and float64) stored inside:

var x float64 = 3.4
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
fmt.Println("type:", v.Type())
fmt.Println("kind is float64:", v.Kind() == reflect.Float64)
fmt.Println("value:", v.Float())
prints

type: float64
kind is float64: true
value: 3.4
There are also methods like SetInt and SetFloat but to use them we need to understand settability, the subject of the third law of reflection, discussed below.

The reflection library has a couple of properties worth singling out. First, to keep the API simple, the "getter" and "setter" methods of Value operate on the largest type that can hold the value: int64 for all the signed integers, for instance. That is, the Int method of Value returns an int64 and the SetInt value takes an int64; it may be necessary to convert to the actual type involved:

var x uint8 = 'x'
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
fmt.Println("type:", v.Type())                            // uint8.
fmt.Println("kind is uint8: ", v.Kind() == reflect.Uint8) // true.
x = uint8(v.Uint())                                       // v.Uint returns a uint64.
The second property is that the Kind of a reflection object describes the underlying type, not the static type. If a reflection object contains a value of a user-defined integer type, as in

type MyInt int
var x MyInt = 7
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
the Kind of v is still reflect.Int, even though the static type of x is MyInt, not int. In other words, the Kind cannot discriminate an int from a MyInt even though the Type can.

The second law of reflection
2. Reflection goes from reflection object to interface value.
Like physical reflection, reflection in Go generates its own inverse.

Given a reflect.Value we can recover an interface value using the Interface method; in effect the method packs the type and value information back into an interface representation and returns the result:

// Interface returns v's value as an interface{}.
func (v Value) Interface() interface{}
As a consequence we can say

y := v.Interface().(float64) // y will have type float64.
fmt.Println(y)
to print the float64 value represented by the reflection object v.

We can do even better, though. The arguments to fmt.Println, fmt.Printf and so on are all passed as empty interface values, which are then unpacked by the fmt package internally just as we have been doing in the previous examples. Therefore all it takes to print the contents of a reflect.Value correctly is to pass the result of the Interface method to the formatted print routine:

fmt.Println(v.Interface())
(Why not fmt.Println(v)? Because v is a reflect.Value; we want the concrete value it holds.) Since our value is a float64, we can even use a floating-point format if we want:

fmt.Printf("value is %7.1e\n", v.Interface())
and get in this case

3.4e+00
Again, there's no need to type-assert the result of v.Interface() to float64; the empty interface value has the concrete value's type information inside and Printf will recover it.

In short, the Interface method is the inverse of the ValueOf function, except that its result is always of static type interface{}.

Reiterating: Reflection goes from interface values to reflection objects and back again.

The third law of reflection
3. To modify a reflection object, the value must be settable.
The third law is the most subtle and confusing, but it's easy enough to understand if we start from first principles.

Here is some code that does not work, but is worth studying.

var x float64 = 3.4
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
v.SetFloat(7.1) // Error: will panic.
If you run this code, it will panic with the cryptic message

panic: reflect.Value.SetFloat using unaddressable value
The problem is not that the value 7.1 is not addressable; it's that v is not settable. Settability is a property of a reflection Value, and not all reflection Values have it.

The CanSet method of Value reports the settability of a Value; in our case,

var x float64 = 3.4
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
fmt.Println("settability of v:", v.CanSet())
prints

settability of v: false
It is an error to call a Set method on an non-settable Value. But what is settability?

Settability is a bit like addressability, but stricter. It's the property that a reflection object can modify the actual storage that was used to create the reflection object. Settability is determined by whether the reflection object holds the original item. When we say

var x float64 = 3.4
v := reflect.ValueOf(x)
we pass a copy of x to reflect.ValueOf, so the interface value created as the argument to reflect.ValueOf is a copy of x, not x itself. Thus, if the statement

v.SetFloat(7.1)
were allowed to succeed, it would not update x, even though v looks like it was created from x. Instead, it would update the copy of x stored inside the reflection value and x itself would be unaffected. That would be confusing and useless, so it is illegal, and settability is the property used to avoid this issue.

If this seems bizarre, it's not. It's actually a familiar situation in unusual garb. Think of passing x to a function:

f(x)
We would not expect f to be able to modify x because we passed a copy of x's value, not x itself. If we want f to modify x directly we must pass our function the address of x (that is, a pointer to x):

f(&x)
This is straightforward and familiar, and reflection works the same way. If we want to modify x by reflection, we must give the reflection library a pointer to the value we want to modify.

Let's do that. First we initialize x as usual and then create a reflection value that points to it, called p.

var x float64 = 3.4
p := reflect.ValueOf(&x) // Note: take the address of x.
fmt.Println("type of p:", p.Type())
fmt.Println("settability of p:", p.CanSet())
The output so far is

type of p: *float64
settability of p: false
The reflection object p isn't settable, but it's not p we want to set, it's (in effect) *p. To get to what p points to, we call the Elem method of Value, which indirects through the pointer, and save the result in a reflection Value called v:

v := p.Elem()
fmt.Println("settability of v:", v.CanSet())
Now v is a settable reflection object, as the output demonstrates,

settability of v: true
and since it represents x, we are finally able to use v.SetFloat to modify the value of x:

v.SetFloat(7.1)
fmt.Println(v.Interface())
fmt.Println(x)
The output, as expected, is

7.1
7.1
Reflection can be hard to understand but it's doing exactly what the language does, albeit through reflection Types and Values that can disguise what's going on. Just keep in mind that reflection Values need the address of something in order to modify what they represent.

Structs
In our previous example v wasn't a pointer itself, it was just derived from one. A common way for this situation to arise is when using reflection to modify the fields of a structure. As long as we have the address of the structure, we can modify its fields.

Here's a simple example that analyzes a struct value, t. We create the reflection object with the address of the struct because we'll want to modify it later. Then we set typeOfT to its type and iterate over the fields using straightforward method calls (see package reflect for details). Note that we extract the names of the fields from the struct type, but the fields themselves are regular reflect.Value objects.

type T struct {
    A int
    B string
}
t := T{23, "skidoo"}
s := reflect.ValueOf(&t).Elem()
typeOfT := s.Type()
for i := 0; i < s.NumField(); i++ {
    f := s.Field(i)
    fmt.Printf("%d: %s %s = %v\n", i,
        typeOfT.Field(i).Name, f.Type(), f.Interface())
}
The output of this program is

0: A int = 23
1: B string = skidoo
There's one more point about settability introduced in passing here: the field names of T are upper case (exported) because only exported fields of a struct are settable.

Because s contains a settable reflection object, we can modify the fields of the structure.

s.Field(0).SetInt(77)
s.Field(1).SetString("Sunset Strip")
fmt.Println("t is now", t)
And here's the result:

t is now {77 Sunset Strip}
If we modified the program so that s was created from t, not &t, the calls to SetInt and SetString would fail as the fields of t would not be settable.

Conclusion
Here again are the laws of reflection:

Reflection goes from interface value to reflection object.
Reflection goes from reflection object to interface value.
To modify a reflection object, the value must be settable.
Once you understand these laws reflection in Go becomes much easier to use, although it remains subtle. It's a powerful tool that should be used with care and avoided unless strictly necessary.

There's plenty more to reflection that we haven't covered — sending and receiving on channels, allocating memory, using slices and maps, calling methods and functions — but this post is long enough. We'll cover some of those topics in a later article.
